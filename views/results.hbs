          The project with the working title "1st Instructions" deals with
          questions of human and machine learning, with artificial intelligence and aspects of "becoming human".
          {{!--  
          In our artistic research, we take a
          look at the platform YouTube, which has become an archive for -
          sometimes almost forgotten - cultural practices. It preserves
          knowledge about "making fire", "growing crops" or "sewing clothes" -
          techniques that are milestones of becoming human. In "1st
          Instructions", exploratory machine learning will be used to create a
          tutorial generator on cultural practices. The instructions generated
          by the machine are then to be performed by us (and other humans) in
          “real life”. Both this process itself and its traces are to be put up
          for public debate - e.g. through readings, performances and
          installation. The potentials of an experimental approach to AI
          technologies are to be explored within a transdisciplinary approach -
          away from optimization efforts based on economic interests. --}}
